# Google-Import
Updates Google Domain Users 

Students are updated on our google domain via a csv gotten from NEFEC. Currently there is a powershell script which compares this csv with our google domain, and updates users as needed. It is bloated and ineffectual. To remedy this, a new script is being developed (this script) in Python with the goal of being more well documented, more robust and full featured, and shorter and easier to read.
